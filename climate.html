<h2>California Climate</h2>
<p>California's climate is diverse, ranging from Mediterranean along the coast to desert and mountain climates in other regions. The coastal areas enjoy mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers, while the inland areas can experience extreme heat in summer and cooler winters.  </p>
	<p>The state’s mountainous regions, like the Sierra Nevada, can have heavy snowfall in the winter. California’s climate is influenced by the Pacific Ocean, which helps moderate temperatures along the coast, and by the state's varied topography, which creates microclimates across the region.</p>

<h2>Death Valley</h2>
<p>Death Valley, located in California, is one of the hottest places on Earth. During summer, temperatures can soar above 120°F (49°C), with the record high reaching 134°F (56.7°C) in 1913. The valley’s low elevation, at 282 feet below sea level, combined with its dry desert environment, creates extreme heat.</p>
<p>The scorching temperatures, combined with its vast, barren landscape, make Death Valley a truly inhospitable yet fascinating place. Despite the harsh conditions, unique plant and animal life have adapted to survive in this intense heat.
